Player amount selection: DONE
Tutorial/Help pop ups: 
If players are forced to be on one tile the forced player has to end the game
You have to move every turn
If you have to give away a fish coin but yo don't have one, you become in debt, that means that when you get another fish coin you have to give it away until your debt is paid

Tiles:
G Ryby - When revealed no fish are gathered by the player who revealed it, its only the next time he steps on the tile
N Voda - Do nothing
N Přikázaný směr - Tells you where you have to go, if there are multiple options you can choose
